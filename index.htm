							<h2><a href="#"> What is Co-Cultural theory </a></h2>
							<p> When several cultures exist in a given territory/society in a given time, each culture is considered as co-culture to each other. Co-culture specially refers to the culture of the non-dominant group, marginalized section of the society.
All diversity of cultures we have around us is influential but some are made invisible through the dominance culture.
Co-cultural theory has been grounded in Muted group theory and Stand point theory. Co-cultural communication refers to interaction between dominant and non-dominant groups. Co-cultural communication is better understood in the light of co-cultural theory
There are several terms to refer to co-culture such as, subordinate culture, inferior culture, non-dominant culture, intra-cultural, minority culture etc.
We choose the term co-culture to avoid negative connotation.
It suggest that in every society a social hierarchy exists that privileges some groups over others. Those groups that function at the top of the social hierarchy determine to a great extent the communication system of the entire society.
Therefore voices of marginalized group members are muted or distorted within a communication system that excludes their live experience as legitimate.
Evaluative criteria of language and communication are developed by the dominant group. Muted group theory focuses on asymmetrical power relations
Non-dominant groups’ worldview is different from the dominant groups’ world view. Co-cultural theory seeks to provide a framework to know how socially powerless people communicate with socially powerful people
Stand point Theory has become popular through the feminist scholars (Harding)
It seeks to explore the daily life experiences of persons situated in subordinate positions. It is guided by the following characteristics.
It starts with concrete life experience, may explore several standpoints within and among different co-cultural groups.
Their experiences need to be brought in theorizing as they have conflicting worldview compared to dominant groups therefore standpoint theory focuses on exploring the alternative worldview.
